---
Welcome to my post about KlukasCraft! KlukasCraft is a small
![Picture of the Server](https://mc.sytes.net/gallery/photos/terra/terra-background.png "Isn't it Beautiful!")
server I've created that is all about kindness and beauty in the small things. KlukasCraft has been around 6 months now. What I started as a small old hardware based minecraft server with only one survival world. I've developed with the help of my friends a Multiverse with Creative and Survival modes, a comprehensive GriefProtection system to keep people's creations safe (Don't be mean. That's it! =) ), a Dynamic WebMap, and a beautiful [website](https://mc.sytes.net).
