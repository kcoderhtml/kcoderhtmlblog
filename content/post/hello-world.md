# Hello World!
Welcome to my "first" blog. Let me explain the "first" part: I have actually had many blogs and web sites in my short life but they all lasted a week at the most on my raspberry pi web server. About 99% of them never got a chance to be exposed to the internet! My fist WordPress site was made with [this](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lamp-web-server-with-wordpress) awesome tutorial on my raspberry pi 3 I got for Christmas. Great right? Well I did not realize that whatever IP address you use to set up the WordPress site with is the one used in all image and style sheet file links! When I went to access the page on my iPad it looked like plain HTML because it thought the style sheets and images were located at `http://localhost/stylesheet.css` or the images at `http://localhost/background.png`! This oddity made made me take a break from WordPress sites and I started learning PHP. Latter I revisited WordPress and had the same issue but was able to resolve it! Now my latest site (this one!) uses _hugo_ as the backend and _ghostwriter_ as the theme. To set up Hugo I followed the tutorial by Flavio Copes [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/your-first-hugo-blog-a-practical-guide/) and spent a afternoon exploring the options and writing this post! Now that you know about me take a moment to check out some of my other posts [here](kcoderhtml.netifly.app).
\nThanks for reading and I hope you have a good day.
