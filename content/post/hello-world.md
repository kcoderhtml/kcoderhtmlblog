# Hello World!
Welcome to my "first" blog. Let me explain the "first" part: I have actually had many blogs and web sites in my short life but they all lasted a week at the most on my raspberry pi webserver. About 90% never had a chance to be exposed to the internet! My fist Wordpress site was made with [this](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lamp-web-server-with-wordpress) awesome tutorial on my raspberry pi 3 I got for Christmas. Great right? Well
